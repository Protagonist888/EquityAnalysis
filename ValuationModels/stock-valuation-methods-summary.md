# Summary of Stock Valuation Methods

## 1. Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio

**Calculation:** P/E Ratio = Market Price per Share / Earnings per Share

**Pros:**
- Simple and widely used
- Easy to compare across similar companies

**Cons:**
- Doesn't account for growth
- Can be misleading for companies with no earnings or cyclical earnings

**When to use:** Best for mature companies with stable earnings

## 2. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

**Calculation:** Sum of future cash flows discounted to present value

**Pros:**
- Considers future growth and cash flows
- Can be used for any company generating cash flows

**Cons:**
- Highly sensitive to assumptions
- Complex and time-consuming

**When to use:** Ideal for stable companies with predictable cash flows

## 3. Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio

**Calculation:** P/B Ratio = Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share

**Pros:**
- Useful for asset-heavy industries
- Good for companies with negative earnings

**Cons:**
- Less relevant for service-based or tech companies
- Doesn't account for intangible assets

**When to use:** Best for financial institutions or asset-intensive industries

## 4. Dividend Discount Model (DDM)

**Calculation:** Present value of all future dividend payments

**Pros:**
- Directly relates to shareholder returns
- Useful for stable, dividend-paying companies

**Cons:**
- Not applicable to non-dividend paying stocks
- Assumes dividends grow at a constant rate

**When to use:** Ideal for mature, stable companies with consistent dividend policies

## 5. Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio

**Calculation:** P/S Ratio = Market Capitalization / Annual Revenue

**Pros:**
- Useful for unprofitable companies
- Less susceptible to accounting manipulations

**Cons:**
- Doesn't consider profitability or efficiency
- Can overvalue high-revenue, low-profit companies

**When to use:** Best for growth companies or industries with cyclical profits

## 6. Enterprise Value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA)

**Calculation:** EV/EBITDA = (Market Cap + Debt - Cash) / EBITDA

**Pros:**
- Accounts for debt levels
- Useful for comparing companies with different capital structures

**Cons:**
- Ignores capital expenditures and working capital changes
- EBITDA can be manipulated

**When to use:** Ideal for comparing companies within the same industry, especially those with different debt levels

## 7. Price-to-Earnings Growth (PEG) Ratio

**Calculation:** PEG Ratio = P/E Ratio / Annual EPS Growth Rate

**Pros:**
- Factors in growth rates
- Useful for comparing growth stocks

**Cons:**
- Relies on earnings estimates, which can be inaccurate
- Less useful for mature, slow-growth companies

**When to use:** Best for growth companies or comparing stocks with different growth rates

## 8. Comparable Company Analysis (Comps)

**Calculation:** Compare various multiples (P/E, EV/EBITDA, etc.) to similar companies

**Pros:**
- Provides market-based valuation
- Useful when limited company-specific data is available

**Cons:**
- Difficult to find truly comparable companies
- May perpetuate market mispricing

**When to use:** Useful in conjunction with other methods or for initial public offerings (IPOs)

## 9. Asset-Based Valuation

**Calculation:** Sum of all company assets minus liabilities

**Pros:**
- Useful for asset-heavy companies
- Provides a "floor" valuation

**Cons:**
- Doesn't account for future earnings potential
- May undervalue companies with significant intangible assets

**When to use:** Best for companies in distress or liquidation scenarios

## 10. Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) Model

**Calculation:** FCFE = Net Income - Net Capital Expenditure - Change in Working Capital + New Debt - Debt Repayment

**Pros:**
- Focuses on cash available to equity holders
- Accounts for capital structure changes

**Cons:**
- Can be volatile year-to-year
- Requires accurate forecasting

**When to use:** Ideal for companies with changing capital structures or significant debt

## Combining Methods

To get a more comprehensive valuation, analysts often use multiple methods in combination:

1. **DCF + Comps:** Use DCF for intrinsic valuation and Comps to check against market sentiment.

2. **P/E + PEG:** Combine to account for both current earnings and growth prospects.

3. **EV/EBITDA + P/B:** Useful for comparing companies with different capital structures and asset bases.

4. **DCF + Asset-Based:** Provides both going-concern and liquidation valuations.

5. **P/S + FCFE:** Combines top-line metrics with cash flow analysis for a more complete picture.

By using multiple methods, analysts can cross-check their valuations and develop a more robust understanding of a stock's worth.
